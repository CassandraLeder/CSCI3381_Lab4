The purpose of this project is to add design patterns to improve the classes from my lab 3 project.
All design patterns were implemented on the Analyzer class. They are as follows:
  1. Strategy - this design pattern was particulary useful for the Analyzer class because it splits the methods up into new classes to easily implement the StrategyAnalyzer interface in order to make it easier to add new statistical methods to the analyzer class. Additionally, it removes the analyzer class from having to understand what is going on with the statistics methods. The classes added for this pattern are the interface StrategyAnalyzer and all its Analyzer_* classes and the interface Strategies which holds a list of all the classes.
  2. Visitor - the primary purpose of implementing this design pattern is to allow the coder to be lazier when performing data analysis. With the visitor class, all the analysis can be done in a simple for loop, which heavily reduces the responsibility of the main function to understand the Analyzer class. The classes added for this pattern are the interface AnalyzerVisitor and its class ConcreteAnalyzerVisitor and the interface Printer and its class AnalyzerPrinter.
Obviously, the Analyzer, Main, and PollingData classes have been completely rewritten to allow for this functionality.
